    "The code you provided is an implementation of the selection sort algorithm. Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum \n",
    "element from the unsorted part of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a high-level explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `selectionSort` function takes a list `l` as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The outer loop, `for start in range(len(l))`, iterates over each element in the list, starting from the first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop, `for i in range(start, len(l))`, which scans the remaining unsorted part of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Within the inner loop, the algorithm finds the minimum value in the unsorted part of the list by comparing each element with the current \n",
    "   minimum value (`l[minpos]`). If a smaller value is found, the `minpos` variable is updated to the index of the new minimum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once the inner loop finishes, the algorithm has identified the minimum value in the remaining unsorted part of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The algorithm then swaps the minimum value (`l[minpos]`) with the first element of the unsorted part of the list (`l[start]`), effectively moving the minimum value to its correct sorted position.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The outer loop continues to the next iteration, and the process repeats until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the selection sort algorithm repeatedly finds the minimum value from the unsorted part of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element, gradually building a sorted portion of the list from left to right."
